    "## **[AI Memory](https://github.com/Mike014/Memory_Augmented_AI/blob/main/Memory_Augmented_AI.ipynb) and Gifted-Inspired Learning: Surpassing the Limits of Catastrophic Forgetting with an Adaptive Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "[My research ](https://github.com/Mike014/Memory_Augmented_AI/blob/main/Memory_Augmented_AI.ipynb)focuses on how an **artificial intelligence can develop a human-like memory**, capable of **restructuring the past and adapting it to the present**. The goal is to **[overcome the problem of forced forgetting in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00796v2)**, creating an architecture inspired by human memory, which selects and maintains relevant information over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Phenomenon in which a **network trained sequentially** on multiple tasks rapidly **forgets** previously acquired knowledge.\n",
    "**Proposed Solution** â†’ **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)**\n",
    "A **biologically inspired algorithm** that **slows learning on critical weights** for previous tasks, **preserving past knowledge** while learning new tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Artificial neural networks**, when **trained on multiple tasks in sequence**, tend to **overwrite the weights optimized for previous tasks**, progressively losing the information learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Main challenges of AI Continual Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tasks can change suddenly** (unpredictable switch).\n",
    "* **Past tasks may not repeat for long periods of time**.\n",
    "* **The architecture must learn without simultaneous access to all previous data** (standard multitask learning would require explicit memory to re-execute old data).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Contrast with Biological Memory**\n",
    "**Humans and other animals** are able to **learn continuously without quickly forgetting** what they have learned. This is done through **synaptic consolidation mechanisms**, which protect the neural circuits that encode important information. \n",
    "**Synapses** are specialized **junctions between neurons**, where **information** is transmitted from one neuron (presynaptic) to another (postsynaptic).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **_\"Synaptic consolidation refers to a set of cellular and molecular processes that strengthen synapses within a local circuit, typically occurring in the first few hours after encoding new information. Synaptic consolidation is essential for the transformation of short-term memories into long-term memories.\"_**\n",
    "\n",
    "**EWC** introduces a **constraint on network parameters** during training to **protect critical weights** for past tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does EWC work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It **identifies the most important weights** for the previous task (Task A).\n",
    "* It **applies a quadratic penalty** that keeps them **close to the previous values**.\n",
    "* It still allows **adaptation to new tasks**."

    "2. **After training on Task B without EWC**, it **lost 7.69%** of its accuracy on **Task A**, demonstrating the **phenomenon of Catastrophic Forgetting**.\n",

    "3. **Train the network on Task B (MNIST with shuffled pixels)**:\n",
    "- **Without EWC**: The network forgets Task A (Catastrophic Forgetting).\n",

    "#### **Connections with Biology and the Brain**\n",

    "Studies show that **synapses** not only **store the value of the weight**, but **also an indication of their uncertainty and stability**.\n",
    "This means that **neurons do not update all weights equally**, but **adjust plasticity depending on the importance of the weight**.\n",
    "In the brain, more stable synapses are less plastic, just like the weights constrained by EWC.\n",
