    "\n",
    "## **1. What is an Algorithm?**\n",
    "An algorithm is a **systematic procedure** that leads to a defined result in a finite number of steps. The term originates from the Persian mathematician **Al-Khwarizmi**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Euclidean Algorithm for GCD**\n",
    "The Euclidean algorithm finds the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** between two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example with 64 and 30:**\n",
    "- 64 / 30 = 2 remainder 4 â†’ Continue dividing.\n",
    "- 30 / 4 = 7 remainder 2 â†’ Continue dividing.\n",
    "- 4 / 2 = 2 remainder 0 â†’ Stop, the GCD is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Implementation in Python:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    " def gcd(a, b):\n",
    "    while b != 0:\n",
    "        a, b = b, a % b\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Numerical Representation and Algorithms**\n",
    "Algorithms do not depend on the numerical system used:\n",
    "- **Decimal system** (base 10)\n",
    "- **Binary system** (base 2)\n",
    "- **Symbol-based system** (||||| to represent 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **2. The Turing Machine**\n",
    "The **Turing Machine** is a theoretical model invented by **Alan Turing** in 1936 to answer the question:\n",
    "> *Is there a mechanical procedure that can solve any mathematical problem?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How does it work?**\n",
    "The Turing Machine consists of:\n",
    "- **An infinite tape**, divided into cells, each containing 0, 1, or being blank.\n",
    "- **A read/write head**, which moves along the tape executing instructions.\n",
    "- **A set of predefined instructions** that determine the machineâ€™s behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Turing Machine Instructions**\n",
    "1. Read the symbol on a cell.\n",
    "2. Replace the symbol with another.\n",
    "3. Move left or right on the tape.\n",
    "4. Change internal state based on a transition table.\n",
    "5. Stop when reaching a final condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Turing Machine for Incrementing a Binary Number**\n",
    "- Move right until the last digit.\n",
    "- If you find a 0, change it to 1 and stop.\n",
    "- If you find a 1, change it to 0 and continue moving left until you find a 0.\n",
    "- If you reach the beginning without finding a 0, add a new 1 at the start of the tape.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- **011 (3 in decimal) â†’ 100 (4 in decimal).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations of the Turing Machine**\n",
    "- **Not practical for real-world use** â†’ It has an infinite tape, while real computers have limited memory.\n",
    "- **Does not account for computing speed** â†’ Some operations may take too long.\n",
    "- **Cannot solve all problems** â†’ The **Halting Problem** proves that some problems cannot be solved by any algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **3. Computability and the Limits of the Turing Machine**\n",
    "### **A. The Halting Problem**\n",
    "Alan Turing proved that **there is no general algorithm** to determine whether any given Turing Machine will halt or run indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Non-Computable Numbers**\n",
    "Some numbers **cannot be calculated** by a Turing Machine:\n",
    "- **Chaitin's Constant**: Represents the probability that a Turing Machine halts with a random input.\n",
    "- **Non-computable irrational numbers**: Some numbers cannot be generated even by an infinite Turing Machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. GÃ¶delâ€™s Theorem**\n",
    "GÃ¶del proved that there exist **mathematical statements that are true but not provable**.\n",
    "- This implies that **we cannot construct an algorithmic system** that solves all mathematical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **4. The Turing Machine and Human Thought**\n",
    "Turing hypothesized that **human thought** could be a mechanical process, similar to a Turing Machine. However, Roger Penrose argues that:\n",
    "1. The human brain may use **non-computable processes** (e.g., quantum phenomena).\n",
    "2. **Intuition and creativity** do not seem reducible to simple algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model of the Mind in Psychology**  \n",
    "According to Freud (and more modern models), the mind is divided into three levels:  \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ **Conscious (Rational and Logical)**  \n",
    "- This is the part of the mind that perceives, thinks, and makes decisions.  \n",
    "- It contains information that we are aware of at any given moment.  \n",
    "- In a Turing Machine, this level would be represented by the **main algorithm**:  \n",
    "  **Input â†’ Processing â†’ Output**  \n",
    "- Similar to how an AI program responds to a question in a chatbot.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ **Subconscious (Automatic and Reactive)**  \n",
    "- Contains habits, intuitions, and automatic processes.  \n",
    "- Influences our behavior without us being fully aware of it.  \n",
    "- Example: Driving a car without actively thinking about hand and foot movements.  \n",
    "- In AI, the subconscious could be represented by a **machine learning system**, such as neural networks:  \n",
    "  - A neural network can recognize faces without \"actively thinking\" about how to do it.  \n",
    "  - Text auto-completion on phones is a practical example of this level.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ **Unconscious (Deep and Inaccessible)**  \n",
    "- Stores thoughts, memories, and impulses that we are unaware of, but that influence our behavior.  \n",
    "- It is the most difficult part to model because it does not follow a direct logical structure.  \n",
    "- In AI, it could be represented by a **raw data memory and unconscious associations**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **conscious part** is the most complex to represent with a Turing Machine. If it perceives, thinks, and makes decisions, where do we place **perception**?  \n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us back to the **ReAct** method in AI agents.  \n",
    "- **Perception** is how we acquire information about the world, a **selective and interpretative process**.  \n",
    "- It differs from objective reality (*\"naÃ¯ve realism\"*).  \n",
    "- The **Gestalt school** identified \"laws\" that organize perception.  \n",
    "- The brain maintains **perceptual constancy** (shape, size, color).  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we analyze **subconscious (automatic and reactive)** processes, it would be naive to simply cite machine learning and deep learning.  \n",
    "- Perhaps, **unconsciously**, we have recreated this level of the mind in AI.  \n",
    "- The **unconscious** stores thoughts, memories, and impulses we are not aware of, yet they shape behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **database** receives and stores **information** and **data**, but memories are automatically connected to the **conscious self**â€”the one who **experiences**.  \n",
    "- **Experience cannot be represented unless it has been lived.**  \n",
    "- This is because experience is acquired **through the senses**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**\"_Perception is the way we acquire information about the world, a selective and interpretative process._\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Global Workspace Theory (GWT): A Model of Consciousness**\n",
    "**GWT** is a hypothesis developed by **Bernard Baars** in the 1980s to explain consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Elements of the Theory**\n",
    "- The brain has **specialized modules** operating in parallel (unconscious processes).\n",
    "- **Attention** selects some processes and brings them to consciousness.\n",
    "- The **Global Workspace** integrates information across modules.\n",
    "- Only information that \"wins the competition\" enters consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy with a theater:**\n",
    "- **Illuminated stage** â†’ Focus of our attention (consciousness).\n",
    "- **Behind the scenes** â†’ Unconscious processes.\n",
    "- **Director** â†’ Executive processes shaping conscious experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **GWT and Computation**\n",
    "GWT is one of the few models of consciousness implementable computationally:\n",
    "- **Transformer (GPT)** â†’ Similar to the attention-selection mechanism.\n",
    "- **EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation)** â†’ Similar to adaptive memory.\n",
    "- **Memory-Augmented Neural Networks (MANN)** â†’ Similar to working memory.\n",
    "- **Multi-agent systems** â†’ Simulating multiple cognitive modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **5. Beyond the Turing Machine: Non-Turing Computation**\n",
    "Some scientists explore models of computation **beyond the Turing Machine**:\n",
    "- **Quantum computers** â†’ Use superposition to perform calculations impossible for a Turing Machine.\n",
    "- **Hypercomputing** â†’ Hypothetical machines that compute non-computable numbers.\n",
    "- **Neuromorphic computing** â†’ Simulates the human brain using biological neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "The **Universal Turing Machine** proves that **any computable algorithm can be executed** by a general-purpose machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "- **It cannot solve all mathematical problems**.\n",
    "- **Human thought may go beyond computability**.\n",
    "- **Consciousness may not be fully simulatable** using a computational system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If human thought were purely computational, then a machine could replicate it. But if there is something **beyond algorithms**, then the human mind will always remain outside pure computation.\n",
