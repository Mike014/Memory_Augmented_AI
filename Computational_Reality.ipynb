    "- Derives from the name of the Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (9th century), whose Latinized name **\"Algoritmi\"** became synonymous with **\"calculation procedure\"**\n",
    "- **Scientific meaning**: A **finite sequence of well-defined instructions for solving a problem** or performing a computation\n",
    "- **Etymological components**:\n",
    "  - \"Algo-\" (Greek): **process, calculation**\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Idealism\n",
    "### Etymology\n",
    "- From Latin **\"idea\" (form, image) and Greek \"idein\" (to see)**\n",
    "- **Philosophical meaning**: A doctrine that considers **reality as founded on ideas**, **thoughts**, and **mental principles** rather than material elements\n",
    "- Conceptual components:\n",
    "  - **Priority of thought** over matter\n",
    "  - **Belief that ultimate reality** is of a mental or spiritual nature\n",

    "### **Abstract**\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper critically examines the **concepts of identity, individuality, and reality** by comparing **classical metaphysical models**, **quantum physics**, and **computational approaches**. Traditional **views of identity—as fixed and materially** continuous—prove **inadequate** when confronted with **scenarios such as cloning, teleportation, and digital replication**. These challenges are further explored through quantum mechanics, which highlights the indistinguishability and contextual nature of fundamental particles, and through the philosophical contributions of thinkers like **Stanisław Lem and Derek Parfit, who redefine individuality as a fluid, distributed, and psychologically connected process.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this theoretical landscape, the framework of **Algorithmic Idealism** emerges as a unifying model. It conceptualizes reality as an emergent construct governed by computational rules that prioritize coherence, informational sufficiency, and observer relevance. Identity is redefined as a **coherent informational state**, decoupled from the **requirement of persistent physical continuity**. This approach integrates key insights from theoretical physics—including the no-cloning theorem, quantum Darwinism, and the Ruliad—with a computational perspective on existence, proposing that **reality is not a static, objective entity but a sequence of observer-dependent informational transitions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this paradigm, **Algorithmic Idealism offers a coherent resolution to identity paradoxes** and provides a robust conceptual foundation for addressing contemporary ethical, ontological, and technological challenges in a computationally mediated world."
